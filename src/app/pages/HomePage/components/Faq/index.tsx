                    <h4>HOW DOES BinancePlus WORK?</h4>
                    <p>It's very simple. Follow these steps:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Use your BINANCE account which is already verified with your documents. If you don't have a BINANCE account yet, open one now by copying and pasting the link in your browser: https://bit.ly/3okkJ2e</li>
                      <li>Have the recommended minimum balance of 150 USDT and or 0.005 BTC.</li>
                      <li>Create an API from your Binance account and register in the BinancePlus system. Your account will start having all the benefits and profits of the BinancePlus platform.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Your BINANCE account CANNOT HAVE another API nor be used for other USDT/BTC/ETH trades.</p>
                    <p>DO NOT turn off or cancel your Binance API. If you shut down or cancel your Binance API, you will need to pay a new BinancePlus plan to be able to rebind.</p>
                    <p>You can have other cryptocurrencies in your BINANCE account and trade with these other cryptocurrencies.</p>

                    <h4>WHAT IS THE VALUE TO USE THE BinancePlus SYSTEM?</h4>
                    <p>The BinancePlus system is marketed exclusively through affiliates who use the technology, showing the advantages and the results of their BINANCE accounts.</p>
                    <p>The value of the plans is according to the performance fee you choose and the affiliate program.</p>
                    <p>Silver, Gold, Premium and Platinum plans are annual, customers of these plans have no maximum capital limit they can have in their Binance accounts.</p>
                    <p>The values â€‹â€‹of these plans vary according to the performance fee charged on the profit generated in your Binance account.</p>
                    <p>Pay the amount in KLAY shown on the invoice plus the amount of the fee charged by your broker. If you pay less than the amount shown on the invoice plus the fee, your invoice will not be recognized as paid by the BinancePlus system and the amount sent will be forfeited. If you use BINANCE to make your payment, the fee amount is already included in the BinancePlus invoice.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><b>Performance Fees</b>
                        <p>Every 30 days, the system generates an individual billing invoice for each strategy on the profit generated in the Binance customer's account. This invoice must be paid within 48 hours. If the customer does not pay the invoice, the BinancePlus system will be paralyzed and will only work again after payment.</p>
                        <p>If there are open orders at the time of invoice generation, the amounts in the orders will be deducted from the generated profits, that is, BinancePlus always charges the performance fee on the profit that is actually available in your account.</p>
                        <p>If there are closed orders with 0% profit and there are discounts from Binance fees that are not reflected in the closed trade statement, BinancePlus may apply a discount on the performance fee charged.</p>
                        <p>For the silver plan above, upon reaching 5 times the bonus plan value of the affiliate program, you must purchase a new plan or higher (in this case only the earnings on the Affiliate Program are added - plan fees and of performance). Here is an example: If you purchased the silver plan, for 100 USDT, as soon as your Affiliate Network produces profits of five times the value of your plan, that is, 500 USDT, you will no longer receive profits from the Affiliate Network. , however your BinancePlus system in your BINANCE account will remain active for a period of one year, if you keep up to date with the payment of the performance fee, based on the date of contracting the plan. When you activate a new silver or higher plan, you will return to receiving your affiliate program bonuses, and will not receive any potential losses (retroactive) while you were on the inactive plan.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li><b>Renovations</b>
                        <p>The BinancePlus affiliate program automatically distributes bonuses to its affiliates according to direct and indirect sales and performance fees. When the bonuses paid to this affiliate reach the plan's earnings limit, the customer must renew their plan generating a new invoice. If the affiliate fails to pay the invoice, automatic affiliate program payments will stop and all future bonuses will be forfeited. On the date this affiliate pays the invoice, the bonus starts again. Failure to pay the renewal invoice does not affect the profit generation system (financial market operations) of plans silver, gold, platinum and premium.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li><b>API DELETION</b>
                        <p>After activating your Binance API with BinancePlus, you will not be able to delete your API under any circumstances. If you delete your API key, you will lose all rights to your current plan and you MUST BUY A NEW PLAN to reconnect your new API.</p>
                      </li>

                    <p>Some people ask if it's normal to go days without opening orders. Yes, this is normal. BinancePlus is an artificial intelligence system that analyzes various market parameters and indicators. It analyzes the direction of whales (big Bitcoin buyers and sellers), buy and sell orders launched on the market, seeks to identify fake orders that are canceled before being executed, monitors the news and its impact on the market through indicators specific. It uses analytical monitoring systems of transaction histories in specific periods according to Bitcoin market sentiment and its co-connection with other financial markets.</p>
                    <p>BinancePlus seeks to carry out operations with the highest degree of assertiveness. The BinancePlus Platform opens dozens and sometimes hundreds of orders. However, in the financial market, the most experienced know that: "Not trading is also trading."</p>

                    <p>Profits from operations on your BINANCE account are generated in USDT and/or BTC directly into your BINANCE account.</p>
                    <p>All operations are carried out on the SPOT market on the BTC/USDT and/or ETH/BTC pair directly on your BINANCE account.</p>
                    <p>All operations performed on your Binance account are reflected on your BinancePlus statement in orders. However, the percentages and values â€‹â€‹shown in the BinancePlus order statement may differ from the values â€‹â€‹displayed in your Binance account and may even vary due to fees, communication interruptions from the Binance API, updates, network interruptions, promotions and/or discounts offered by BinancePlus technology.</p>
                    <p>Profits from the Affiliate Program are automatically credited to your KLAY wallet registered in the BinancePlus system. Use your Binance account's KLAY wallet to receive your Affiliate Program bonuses. We are not responsible for KLAY wallets that are not from Binance as there are exchanges that require minimum amounts to receive KLAY and therefore some BinancePlus Affiliate Program commissions may not arrive because they are lower amounts.</p>
